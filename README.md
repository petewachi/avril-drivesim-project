**Master's Research Project - University of Waterloo**

---

## About the Research

This project explores innovative approaches in the domains of Human Factors Engineering, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) with a focus on enhancing road safety for autonomous driving. The research involved developing a dynamic alert system tailored to drivers' cognitive states, aimed at improving takeover readiness in automated driving scenarios. The study involved rigorous user research, conducted over 1.5 months with 40 participants, and employed advanced driving simulation technologies to assess the effectiveness of these dynamic alerts.

## Research Problem

In semi-autonomous vehicles, ensuring that drivers can quickly and effectively resume control during critical situations is paramount. Traditional alert systems often fail to account for the driver's cognitive state, which can lead to delayed or inappropriate responses. The research sought to address the challenge of designing an alert system that adapts to the driver's cognitive load, enhancing their readiness and ability to take over the vehicle when necessary.

## Methodology

### Human Factors and Tools

- **Participants:** The study involved 40 participants, ranging in age from 18 to 54, all of whom had at least one year of driving experience. The research was conducted at the Autonomous Vehicle Research and Intelligence Laboratory (AVRIL) at the University of Waterloo.
- **Driving Simulator:** The experiments were conducted using VI-Grade’s high-fidelity STATIC driving simulator, which replicates real-world driving conditions. The simulator was integrated with MATLAB Simulink for ADAS control models, and VI-WorldSim for developing driving scenarios.
- **UI/UX Design:** The driver dashboard and alert systems were designed using Figma and Qt QML, focusing on enhancing user experience across various driving scenarios.
- **Mixed-Methods Research:** The study employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods, including physiological measurements (heart rate monitoring, eye tracking) and post-scenario questionnaires to assess driver responses and alert effectiveness.

### Experimental Setup

- **Driving Scenarios:** Participants engaged in four different driving scenarios, each involving a critical situation where a takeover request (TOR) was necessary. Scenarios included road closures, sudden obstacles (e.g., animals on the road), and vehicles merging unexpectedly.
- **Alert Design:** Two types of alert systems were tested: a static single alert and a dynamic alert that varied in intensity based on the driver's cognitive state. Alerts were delivered through visual messages on the dashboard and auditory signals.
- **Cognitive States:** The research classified cognitive states into two categories—focused attention (no secondary task) and distracted state (engaged in a secondary typing task on a smartphone).

## Research Results

The study demonstrated that dynamic alert systems significantly improve takeover performance compared to static alerts, particularly in high-distraction scenarios. Key findings include:

- **Response Time:** On average, dynamic alerts reduced response times by approximately 1.75 seconds compared to static alerts.
- **Driver Confidence:** Participants reported higher levels of confidence when dynamic alerts were employed, especially in scenarios involving secondary tasks.
- **Alert Effectiveness:** Dynamic alerts were found to be more effective in capturing attention without causing undue stress or annoyance, as indicated by high attention-capturing scores and low annoyance ratings.
- **Physiological Impact:** The study observed higher lateral accelerations and more decisive maneuvering under strong alert conditions, indicating a heightened state of readiness and effective takeover.

## Future Work

The promising results of this study suggest several avenues for future research:

- **On-Road Validation:** While this study was conducted in a simulated environment, future research should validate these findings in real-world driving conditions.
- **Broader Alert Modalities:** Exploring a wider range of alert modalities, including haptic feedback and more complex auditory cues, could further enhance the effectiveness of dynamic alert systems.
- **Refinement of Physiological Monitoring:** Improving the accuracy and responsiveness of physiological monitoring tools, such as real-time cognitive state detection, will be crucial for the continued development of adaptive alert systems.
